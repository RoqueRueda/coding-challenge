# 3. VersionCatalogs

Date: 2022-05-26

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We want to have a better dependency management and less error-prone as well the use of code
completion.

## Decision

We want to sue version catalogs with TOML File feature that was introduced in gradle 7.0

## Consequences

We need to navigate to TOML files to find all version catalogs
